## Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A few simple guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include screenshots or notes for UI changes.
- If your change affects the database schema or seed data, run `npm run init-db` locally and include notes in the PR.
- Write tests where applicable and ensure `npm run init-db` passes.
- Use `main` as the default branch to target with PRs.

Maintainers will review and request changes as needed. Celebrate small wins 🎉
